        "On June 10, 1912, Josiah and Sarah Moore were bludgeoned to death inside of their home in Villisca, Iowa. Their four children—and two friends who were spending the night—were also killed, and to this day, the crime remains unsolved. Their home is considered one of the most haunted houses in the country, and guests are drawn to it. People even pay $400+ to stay for one night."

        "The former residence of a number of lighthouse keepers, this home has been featured on several ghost-hunting shows. There seems to be only one spirit here, named 'Ernie' —but he's got a very strong presence. He likes to turn televisions off and on, take sheets off beds, and generally cause a ruckus with knocking. If you prefer your haunts on dry land, make sure to visit Connecticut's ghost town."

        "Here lies a timeless story. In the oldest wing of one of the oldest resorts in the country (built in 1766), a jilted woman took her own life after her fiancé left her on their wedding day and never returned. Since that tragic day in the early 1900s she's wandered the 14th floor aimlessly, stopping guests and employees to ask for the time, hoping that she'll catch the hour when her groom-to-be is supposed to come back to her—and that this time around he'll be there."

Fast forward to the 1950s, when the facility reached its peak and had more than 2,400 patients living in overcrowded and inhumane conditions—with some even kept in cages. In 1994, the asylum closed, and today, there are reports of paranormal activity, with souls of patients lingering and roaming the halls."
