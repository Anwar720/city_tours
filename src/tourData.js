        "On June 10, 1912, Josiah and Sarah Moore were bludgeoned to death inside of their home in Villisca, Iowa. Their four children—and two friends who were spending the night—were also killed, and to this day, the crime remains unsolved. Their home is considered one of the most haunted houses in the country, and guests are drawn to it. People even pay $400+ to stay for one night."

        "Letchworth opened in the early 20th century to care for mentally handicapped individuals. It is a residential institution and hopsital to provide self-sufficiency the physically and mentally disabled of all ages. The facility eventually closed for good in 1996, and its buildings slipped into disrepair—becoming a ghost town. Many have died to abuse, malnutrition, and neglect in this instituation. In result, a cemetery filled with graves mark the remains of the dead of Letchworth Village. A memorial stone bears the inscription “THOSE WHO SHALL NOT BE FORGOTTEN” and lists hundreds of names. Grave markers bear only serial numbers assigned to the dead."

        info:
        "Thomas Whaley built this family estate in 1857 in San Diego, on the former site of the city's first public gallows. Shortly after he moved in, he reported hearing the heavy footsteps of Yankee Jim Robinson, a drifter and thief who was hanged on the site four years before the house was built. Whaley's family history ended up being filled with tragic deaths and suicides, many of which occurred inside the home itself. Some of the family members reportedly still haunt the landmark, often accompanied by cigar smoke and the smell of heavy perfume."

        "The former residence of a number of lighthouse keepers, this home has been featured on several ghost-hunting shows. There seems to be only one spirit here, named 'Ernie' —but he's got a very strong presence. He likes to turn televisions off and on, take sheets off beds, and generally cause a ruckus with knocking. If you prefer your haunts on dry land, make sure to visit Connecticut's ghost town."

        "Here lies a timeless story. In the oldest wing of one of the oldest resorts in the country (built in 1766), a jilted woman took her own life after her fiancé left her on their wedding day and never returned. Since that tragic day in the early 1900s she's wandered the 14th floor aimlessly, stopping guests and employees to ask for the time, hoping that she'll catch the hour when her groom-to-be is supposed to come back to her—and that this time around he'll be there."

        "Waverly Hills Sanatorium started off as a one-room schoolhouse in the late 1800s. The Board of Tuberculosis Hospital later purchased the land and built the sanatorium, which opened in 1910 as a small quarantine for tuberculosis patients. The large building that now sits abandoned was built in 1926 in response to the need for a larger facility; the sanatorium could house over 400 patients."

        info:
        "Opened in 1896, the Ohio State Reformatory is famous for its Gothic facade and ominous six-story cell block. But its greatest claim to fame is when it served as the filming location for The Shawshank Redemption, though the prison was shrouded in terror long before Red and Andy holed up there. The reformatory closed in 1990 due to overcrowding and inhumane conditions, but not before more than 200 people (including two guards) died in the building. Legend says that the ghosts of several former inmates still roam the halls, as well as an old guard who jabs people with his nightstick. There are various ways for visitors to experience the hauntings first-hand, from two-hour guided tours to private paranormal investigations."

Fast forward to the 1950s, when the facility reached its peak and had more than 2,400 patients living in overcrowded and inhumane conditions—with some even kept in cages. In 1994, the asylum closed, and today, there are reports of paranormal activity, with souls of patients lingering and roaming the halls."
