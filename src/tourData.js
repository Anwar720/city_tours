        "On June 10, 1912, Josiah and Sarah Moore were bludgeoned to death inside of their home in Villisca, Iowa. Their four children—and two friends who were spending the night—were also killed, and to this day, the crime remains unsolved. Their home is considered one of the most haunted houses in the country, and guests are drawn to it. People even pay $400+ to stay for one night."

        "The former residence of a number of lighthouse keepers, this home has been featured on several ghost-hunting shows. There seems to be only one spirit here, named 'Ernie' —but he's got a very strong presence. He likes to turn televisions off and on, take sheets off beds, and generally cause a ruckus with knocking. If you prefer your haunts on dry land, make sure to visit Connecticut's ghost town."
